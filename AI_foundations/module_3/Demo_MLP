âœ… Step 1: Data Generation
--> We generate concentric circles dataset using make_circles.
--> Parameters we can change:

n_samples (e.g., 300) â†’ number of data points

noise (e.g., 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) â†’ randomness in data points

factor (e.g., 0.7) â†’ distance between inner and outer circle

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

With higher noise, circles look fuzzier and harder to separate.

With factor = 0.7, circles move closer together.

âœ… Step 2: Understanding the MLP Classifier
--> MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) has:

Input layer (x, y coordinates of points)

Hidden layer(s) â†’ multiple neurons â†’ nonlinear decision boundary

Output layer (predicts label 0 or 1)

--> We use:

hidden_layer_sizes=(n,) â†’ n neurons in one hidden layer

activation="relu" â†’ helps create nonlinear boundaries

max_iter â†’ maximum training iterations

random_state â†’ fixes randomness for reproducibility

âœ… Step 3: Effect of Neurons on Decision Boundary
ðŸ‘‰ Starting small â†’ increasing complexity:

1 neuron â†’ all points predicted as one class â†’ poor performance

2 neurons â†’ boundary appears, but still many misclassifications

3 neurons â†’ more curved boundary, more accurate

4 neurons â†’ even better classification

5â€“6 neurons â†’ decision boundary becomes more complex and accurate

Analogy â†’
Think of neurons as artists drawing boundaries:

With 1 artist â†’ just a straight line

With more artists â†’ more curves, twists, and flexibility â†’ better fit

âœ… Step 4: Interactive Slider (Visualization)
--> We create a slider widget for hidden layer size.
--> Every time slider moves â†’ classifier retrains with new neuron count â†’ updated plot shown.

âœ… Step 5: How the update_plot Function Works

Generate training dataset (X: coordinates, y: labels).

Initialize MLPClassifier with chosen hidden layer size.

Train classifier with (X, y).

Create a grid of new data points (100Ã—100 mesh) covering dataset range.

Predict labels for these new points.

Reshape predictions to 2D â†’ for plotting decision boundaries.

Plot results:

Decision boundary â†’ using plt.contourf

Points â†’ class 0 = red, class 1 = green

Labels, title â†’ added for clarity

âœ… Step 6: Final Visualization
--> Contour plot shows how decision boundary adapts with neuron count
--> Scatter plot overlays training data (red/green points)
--> Interactive slider lets us explore model capacity in real time

âœ… Key Takeaways
--> More neurons â†’ more flexible boundary â†’ better fit to data
--> Too few neurons â†’ underfitting (poor classification)
--> Visualization helps us understand bias-variance tradeoff in neural networks
