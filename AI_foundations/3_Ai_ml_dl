-> AI vs ML vs DL----------------------------------
Hi, and welcome to this module on AI versus ML versus DL. Let's understand the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning with some simple examples.

-> Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI refers to the broader concept of creating machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

--> Example:
A self-driving car that can make decisions like a human driver, such as navigating traffic, detecting pedestrians, and making safe lane changes.

A voice assistant (e.g., Alexa, Siri) that understands and responds to natural language commands.

-> Machine Learning (ML)
ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable machines to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

--> Example:
A spam email filter that learns to identify spam based on previous email interactions and content.

Netflix’s recommendation system that suggests movies based on your watch history.

--> Algorithm in ML:
An algorithm in ML is a specific set of rules, mathematical equations, or procedures that a model follows to learn from data and make predictions.

-> Deep Learning (DL)
DL is a subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to learn and make sense of complex patterns in data.

--> Example:
Image recognition software that can detect objects or animals in pictures, such as recognizing cats in internet photos.

Voice-to-text systems like Google Speech Recognition.

-> Types of Machine Learning--------------------------------

--> Supervised Learning

Algorithm learns from labeled data (input with correct answers).

Example: Credit card approval prediction based on historical approval/rejection data.

--> Unsupervised Learning

Algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data.

Example: Grouping customers into clusters based on spending habits for targeted marketing.

--> Reinforcement Learning

Algorithm learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions.

Example: Teaching a robot to walk by rewarding it for forward movement and penalizing falls.


-> Supervised Learning in Action: Credit Card Approval Example

Past data = historical approvals and rejections.
Algorithm trains on this labeled data.
Model predicts whether a new application should be approved.

--> Manual/Rules Engine Drawbacks:

Slow
Requires skilled people to update rules
Rules change often

--> Supervised ML Advantages:

Learns from historical patterns without manual rule creation.

-> Unsupervised Learning in Action: Retail Clustering Example

Data: Household size, income, location, occupation.
Algorithm clusters customers into groups (e.g., small family, high spenders).
Used for targeted marketing and promotions.

--> Additional Example: Nutritional Similarity

Cluster fruits and vegetables based on nutritional values.

Helps create balanced diet plans by including diverse nutrients.

-> Reinforcement Learning in Action: Game Playing Example

Player (agent) makes a move → checks feedback → stores outcome in memory → uses knowledge for next move.

Example: Chess AI learning optimal moves by playing millions of games against itself.

Real-world use: Autonomous driving systems making decisions in traffic based on trial-and-error simulations.

-> Deep Learning for Image Recognition Example

Can’t classify cats vs dogs by a single pixel — needs multiple features.
Deep neural networks automatically extract features from raw pixel data.

Example: Facebook’s automatic photo tagging based on facial recognition.

-> Neural Networks

Layers of neurons (artificial brain cells) connected together.
Often used in supervised ML for tasks like function approximation — estimating unknown relationships from known data.

-> Generative AI
A subset of ML that creates new content (text, audio, images, etc.) based on learned patterns.

--> Examples:

ChatGPT generating text responses.
DALL·E creating images from text prompts.
Music composition AI producing original tunes.
