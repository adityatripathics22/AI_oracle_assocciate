-> 1. OCI Vision AI Service
--> Key capabilities
---> Image Classification – Identify objects or scenes in an image.
  Example: Detecting “vegetation” with a 99.23% confidence score.
---> Object Detection – Identify and locate multiple objects with bounding boxes.
  Example: Detecting cars, taxis, and pedestrians in traffic images.
---> Text Detection – Extract printed or handwritten text from images.
  Example: Detecting bus number plate “M32HOD” and other text on the bus.
---> Document AI – Analyze and extract structured information from documents.
  Example: Reading receipts, extracting transaction date/time, totals, and table data.

--> Image Classification Demonstrations
---> Single zebra detected along with labels like “vegetation,” “grassland,” and “animal.”
---> Two zebras detected, labeled as “animal,” “vegetation,” “sky,” and “mammal.”

--> Object Detection Demonstrations
---> Traffic scene: cars, taxi, and people detected with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
---> Basket of fruit: orange, banana, apple, and even the bowl detected.

--> Text Detection Demonstrations
---> Bus with text: number plate, route number, and smaller text blocks extracted.
---> Different fonts: service accurately extracts text in varied fonts (e.g., Arial, Arial Black).

--> Document AI Demonstrations
---> Receipt: raw text extracted from “Receipt” to “Thank You.”
---> Key-value pairs identified: transaction date/time, subtotal, tax, total.
---> Tables extracted:
  1. Itemized purchase list.
  2. Total cost table.
  3. Card authorization details.

-> 2. OCI AI Language Service
--> Main capabilities
---> Text Analysis – Apply pretrained models for insights from text.
---> Text Translation – Translate text into multiple target languages.

--> Text Analysis Features
---> Language detection.
  Example: Detecting English as the language.
---> Text classification.
  Example: Classifying a paragraph as “Science & Technology.”
---> Entity extraction.
  Example: Detecting “food,” “computers,” and tagging them as products/events.
---> Key phrase extraction.
  Example: Extracting “early computers” and “simple manual instruments.”
---> Sentiment analysis.
  Example: Determining positive or negative sentiment for aspects like “food” or “service.”
---> Sentence-level sentiment detection.
  Example: Marking sentences as negative or neutral.
---> Personal identifiable information detection.
  Example: Highlighting sensitive data such as dates from World War II.

--> Text Translation Demonstrations
---> Translating English text to French in seconds.
---> Translating English text to Japanese with similar speed.

--> Custom Model Training
---> Users can upload custom data to train models tailored to their needs.
