✅ What is AI?
--> AI: Machines imitating human intelligence.
--> Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI where algorithms learn from past data to make predictions or identify patterns.
--> Deep Learning (DL): A further subset of ML using neural networks to handle complex data.

✅ What is Generative AI?
--> Definition: AI that creates new content (text, images, music, video, etc.).
--> Key Idea: Learns patterns from existing data and generates new examples following those patterns.
--> Difference from ML:

ML → learns relationship between data and labels → output is classification/prediction.

GenAI → learns patterns in unstructured data → output is new generated content.

✅ Example of Generative AI
--> Train model with dog pictures.
--> Model learns features (ears, fur, whiskers).
--> Generates a new dog image (not copied, but created).

✅ How Training Differs (ML vs GenAI)
--> ML (Supervised): Needs labeled data (picture + “dog”).
--> GenAI: Pre-trained on large unlabeled data.
--> GenAI can later be fine-tuned with labeled data for specific tasks.

✅ Types of Generative AI Models
--> Text-based models: Generate text, dialogues, articles, or code. Learn from large text collections.
--> Multimodal models: Handle multiple data types (text, images, audio, video). Example: Generate image from a text prompt.

✅ Applications of Generative AI
--> Content creation (articles, designs, media).
--> Image & video generation.
--> Medicine & Drug Discovery: Faster diagnosis and drug development.
--> Automation and creative assistance across industries.

✅ Key Difference (One Line)
--> ML = Predicts/labels.
--> GenAI = Generates new data/content.
