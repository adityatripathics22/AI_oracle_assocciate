✅ Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)
--> A language model is a probabilistic model of text.
--> It predicts the probability of a word occurring in a sequence based on the previous words.
--> Helps in predicting the next most likely word.

✅ Example of a Language Model
--> Sentence: “I wrote to the zoo to send me a pet. They sent me ___.”
--> Vocabulary: lion, elephant, dog, cat, panther, etc.
--> Model assigns probabilities (e.g., lion = 0.03, elephant = 0.02, dog = 0.45).
--> Picks the word with highest probability (“dog”).
--> Appends the word and updates probabilities for the next word.
--> May output EOS (End of Sentence) token to finish the sentence.

✅ What Does “Large” in LLM Mean?
--> Refers to the number of parameters (weights in the neural network).
--> Parameters can scale from hundreds of millions to billions.
--> No strict threshold between small and large.
--> Model size = memory needed to store parameters & structures.
--> More parameters ≠ always better → risk of overfitting.

✅ What Can You Do with LLMs?
--> Question Answering: “What is the capital of France?” → Paris.
--> Reasoning & Puzzles: Can explain reasoning steps.
--> Content Generation: Essays, articles, stories.
--> Translation: E.g., “How are you” → Comment allez-vous? (French).
--> Summarization & Sentiment Analysis: Understands and condenses text.

✅ How Do LLMs Work?
--> Based on transformer architecture.
--> Transformers allow models to pay selective attention to input context.
--> This gives enhanced contextual understanding.
--> Trained on massive text datasets (internet-scale data).

✅ Key Characteristics of LLMs
--> Use deep neural networks.
--> Predict the next word in a sequence using optimized parameters.
--> Parameters are adjustable weights tuned during training.
--> Growth trend: Models scaling up (hundreds of billions of parameters).
--> Some models’ parameter counts are undisclosed (may exceed 540B).

✅ Summary
--> LLMs = probabilistic models predicting word sequences.
--> Powered by transformer deep learning architecture.
--> Used for Q&A, reasoning, text generation, translation, summarization.
--> Parameters scale massively, but larger ≠ always better.
