Supervised Learning – Classification

✅ Supervised ML outputs --> Can be categorical or continuous
✅ Continuous output --> Use Regression (e.g., predicting house prices)
✅ Categorical output --> Use Classification (predict a category or label)

What is Classification?

✅ Definition --> A supervised learning problem where the goal is to assign a category or label to the outcome
✅ Binary classification --> Two possible categories (e.g., email spam/not spam)
✅ Multi-class classification --> More than two categories (e.g., sentiment prediction: positive, negative, neutral)
✅ Classifier --> Trained on labeled dataset to categorize data points based on features

Example

✅ Spam detection --> Classifier predicts if an email is spam or not (binary classification)
✅ Sentiment prediction --> Classifier identifies positive, negative, neutral sentiments (multi-class classification)

Logistic Regression for Classification

✅ Purpose --> Predicts if something is true or false (binary outcomes)
✅ Example --> Pass/Fail prediction based on hours studied
✅ Input feature --> Hours of study (independent variable)
✅ Output --> Pass or Fail (binary)

✅ Difference from Linear Regression -->
--> Linear regression fits a straight line
--> Logistic regression fits an S-shaped curve (sigmoid function)

✅ Sigmoid function -->
--> Maps any real number into a range between 0 and 1
--> Interpreted as a probability

✅ Decision rule -->
--> If probability > 0.5 --> Classify as Pass
--> If probability ≤ 0.5 --> Classify as Fail

✅ Example probabilities -->
--> 6 hours study → 80% probability → Pass
--> 4 hours study → 20% probability → Fail

Multi-Class Example – Iris Dataset

✅ Dataset --> 150 instances of 3 iris flower species:
--> Iris-setosa
--> Iris-versicolor
--> Iris-virginica

✅ Features --> Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
✅ Output label --> 3 classes representing flower types
✅ Type --> Multi-class classification using logistic regression
