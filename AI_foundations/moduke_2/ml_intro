What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating computer systems that can learn and make predictions from examples without being explicitly programmed.
It uses algorithms that learn automatically from data --> enabling machines to improve performance over time.

Everyday Examples of ML

✅ Product recommendations --> Amazon suggests items based on your shopping history
✅ Movie recommendations --> Netflix suggests movies/shows based on viewing patterns
✅ Spam detection --> Email service flags spam using content classification
✅ Self-driving cars --> ML helps navigate and reach destinations

How Does ML Work?

✅ Input Data (Features) --> Descriptive attributes (e.g., color, texture, eye color for cats/dogs)
✅ Labels (Output) --> Desired result for each data point (e.g., “Cat” or “Dog”)
✅ Training Data --> Dataset with both features and labels
✅ Model Training --> The ML model learns the relationship between features and labels
✅ Trained Model --> The learned system ready to make predictions
✅ Inference --> Using the trained model to predict outcomes for new data

Types of Machine Learning

✅ Supervised Learning
--> Uses: Labeled data (features + labels)
--> Goal: Learn mapping from inputs to outputs
--> Examples: Disease detection, weather forecasting, stock price prediction, spam detection, credit scoring

✅ Unsupervised Learning
--> Uses: Unlabeled data
--> Goal: Find hidden patterns or groupings in data
--> Examples: Fraud detection, customer segmentation, outlier detection, targeted marketing

✅ Reinforcement Learning
--> Uses: Feedback (rewards/penalties) to improve decisions
--> Goal: Learn strategies that maximize rewards
--> Examples: Automated robots, autonomous driving cars, game-playing AI

Summary

✅ Supervised Learning --> Learn from labeled examples
✅ Unsupervised Learning --> Discover hidden structures without labels
✅ Reinforcement Learning --> Learn by trial, error, and feedback to maximize long-term rewards
