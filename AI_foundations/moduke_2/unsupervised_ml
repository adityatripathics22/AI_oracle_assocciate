Unsupervised Machine Learning
Introduction

✅ Definition -->
--> Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where there are no labeled outputs.
--> The algorithm learns patterns and relationships in the data and groups similar data items.

✅ Key Idea -->
--> The patterns are explored explicitly without being told what to look for.

Examples

✅ Example 1: LEGO pieces -->
--> Give a child a set of LEGO pieces and ask them to group them.
--> The child may group based on color, size, or type.

✅ Example 2: Fruits -->
--> Basket of apples, bananas, and oranges.
--> Group based on similarities like round/red fruits vs elongated/yellow fruits.
--> This is an unsupervised learning task.

Clustering

✅ Definition -->
--> Clustering groups data items based on similarity.
--> Items in the same cluster are more similar than items in other clusters.
--> Items that do not fit any cluster are called outliers.

✅ Example -->
--> Grapes could be an outlier compared to apples, pears, and strawberries.

Use Cases of Unsupervised Learning

✅ Market Segmentation -->
--> Example: Use online shop purchase data to cluster customers.
--> Similar buying behaviors can help target ads (e.g., sports products for protein buyers).

✅ Outlier Analysis -->
--> Example: Credit card transactions.
--> Fraudulent transactions are identified as outliers (e.g., very high or recurring amounts).

✅ Recommendation Systems -->
--> Example: Movie or music viewing history.
--> Cluster users based on preferences to provide personalized recommendations (e.g., Netflix).

Key Concept: Similarity

✅ Definition -->
--> Similarity measures how close two data points are, value between 0 and 1.
--> Closer to 1 --> more similar objects.

✅ Example -->
--> Apple and cherry may have high similarity based on color.

✅ Common Similarity Metrics -->
--> Euclidean distance
--> Manhattan distance
--> Cosine similarity
--> Jaccard similarity

Workflow of Unsupervised Learning

✅ Step 1: Prepare the Data -->
--> Remove missing values
--> Normalize data
--> Feature scaling

✅ Step 2: Create Similarity Matrix -->
--> Choose appropriate similarity metric based on data and algorithm

✅ Step 3: Run Clustering Algorithm -->
--> Partition-based clustering
--> Hierarchical-based clustering
--> Density-based clustering
--> Distribution-based clustering

✅ Step 4: Interpret and Adjust Clusters -->
--> Check clustering quality iteratively
--> Verify results against expectations at cluster and example levels
